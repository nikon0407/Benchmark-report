Hi there
We need to complete a few stages at the beginning of the program before we can see the outcomes.
1. First Action: 
    open your computer's Docker Desktop.
2. Step: 
    On your computer, open CMD (Command Prompt).
3. Step: 
    Place yourself in the code directory, ...\eksperimentalni_rad\without_test.
4. Step: 
    Type "docker build -t python_experimental_test.\" to begin the process.
5. Step: 
    You may now run "docker images" to check if your image is active. If the image name appears on the screen, everything is OK and you can move further.
6. Step: 
    The outcomes of the command "docker run python_experimental_test" will be shown.
